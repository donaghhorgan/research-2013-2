=== Usage ===

The repository is organised as follows:

  * The .nb files are Mathematica notebooks and provide the means to generate 
    the results from the paper, or create new sets of results.
  * The .m files are Mathematica packages, providing function definitions 
    used in the notebooks - you do not need to edit these directly (in fact, 
    you don't have to look at them at all if you don't want to - Mathematica 
    will load them at runtime). For information on individual functions, 
    see help.nb.
